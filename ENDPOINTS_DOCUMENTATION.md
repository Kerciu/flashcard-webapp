  The JWT token includes claims like `issuer`, `subject`, `email`, `issuedAt`, and `expiration` time. The token is signed using a secret key (`jwtSecret`).

- **OAuth2 Integration**:  
  OAuth2 login will automatically map users based on the email retrieved from the OAuth2 provider. If the user does not exist in the database, they will be created with a profile creation date.
